<i>"Are you frustrated to the fact that you are the weakest one? If so, hold on to that feeling. That's proof that you haven't given up yet, on yourself. Listen, don't give up saying that you're living within your boundaries. Don't be a boring person like that. If you have the guts to not give up, you can become anything you want to be. We're living creatures that don't have wings, but still went to the moon."</i> - Ryouma Kurogane
